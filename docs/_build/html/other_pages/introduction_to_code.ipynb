    "\n",
    "The functioning of a tool is usually easier to grasp when its utility and purpose are made plain.  I'll therefore start with a brief wrap-up of our project goals. As explained in the `README.md` and on our [webpage](https://mromanello.github.io/ajax-multi-commentary/), our main goal is to create a dynamic interface to query, display and compare classical commentaries. To this purpose, we rely on a single source of data: scanned images of commentaries. To go all the way from images to information extraction, we will have to complete several steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AjmcImage processing** aims at preparing and enhancing our images.\n",
    "2. **OCR** then converts the images to machine-readable text.\n",
    "3. **OLR** performs layout analysis to extract the regions we are interested in.\n",
    "4. **Alignment** maps single comments to the snippet of text they are actually commenting.\n",
    "5. **NLP** extract meaningful information from these comments."

    "How do these steps translate into code ? You may have seen that each of the aforementioned steps has a directory in `ajmc/`. These step-oriented directory are called **task-specific** directories. This being said, you may also have seen two exceptions:\n",
    "1. First, as we generally could get good quality scans, we take image processing for granted. There are only a few helpers for binarization which can be found in `commons/image.py`.\n",
    "2. Secondly, there are two directories `ajmc/` which do not correspond directly to any steps mentioned above : `ajmc/commons` and `ajmc/text_processing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be too long to go through all the task-specific directories. For a general understanding of the code, it is better to start with `commons` and `text_processing`, as these two are massively used by each task."

    "\n",
    "The meaning of \"*text* processing\" in `ajmc/text_processing` is not to be confused with (natural) *language* processing in `ajmc/nlp`. As a matter of fact `text_processing` doesn't deal with NLP at all. It allows for the manipulation source texts (generally OCR outputs) and exports them to different formats for later use. For a more detailed view of our text pipeline, please check `/notebooks/commentary_importation_pipeline.ipynb`. Its most important function is to unify the diversity of OCR output formats in a single canonical json.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are therefore three types of objects in `text_processing`:\n",
    "1. Ocr objects, which can be found in `text_processing/ocr_classes/` and which deal with OCR output files.\n",
    "2. Canonical objects, which can unsurprisingly be found in `text_processing/canonical_classes` and deal with the canonical format jsons.\n",
    "3. Generic objects, can be found in `text_processing/generic_classes`. They are abstract object which determine methods and properties used by both canonical and ocr objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these objects have some common attributes, but also particularities due to their nature and also to the level of text containers they represent. Indeed, both `Ocr-` and `Canonical-` objects can represent various levels of text containers commentaries, pages, page regions, lines and words. We hence end up with the following classes :"

Though this structure may seem complicated, it is the results of several explorations (single classes with type- or level-conditioned functions, no inheritance...) and appeared to be the best balance between conflicting design principles such as systematicity, simplicity, efficiency and maintanibility."

    "### `text_processing` objects and their main attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Both canonical and ocr objects have specific attributes in the nitty-gritty of which we will not enter here. Let us all review the most common and important attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The parent-children system\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object must implement a method to call it's direct parents and children. Note that \"parent\" and \"children\" do not refer to the inheritance of python objects here. Rather, they refer to the inclusion of textual objects within each other. Hence, when I say that a `Line` counts among a `Page`'s \"children\", I do **not** mean that `-Line` objects are child-classes of `-Page` objects. Similarly, a `Region`-level object must be able to call its parent `Page` and its children lines. The grammar for this is `TextContainer.parents.level` or `TextCoontainer.children.level[+s]`. Notice the singular for parents (eg. `self.parents.page`) and the plural for children (e.g. `self.children.pages`, reflecting the fact that `OcrLine.parent.page` returns a single `OcrPage`, whereas `OcrCommentary.children.pages` returns a list of `OcrPage`s. Under the hood, `children` and `parent` call `self._get_children(self, children_type)` and `self._get_parents(self, parent_type)` respectively. Every `TextContainer` must implement these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system allows for a very fluid navigation between the elements of commentaries, and turns complex queries (e.g. getting all the potentially abbreviated words in all the footnotes of a commentary) into relatively simple one liner (in our case `[w for r in commentary.children.regions if r.region_type == \"footnote\" for w in r.children.words if w.text.endswith('.')]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "`Page` level object have a direct link to their image, stored as an `ajmc.commons.image.AjmcImage` and part of the `Commentary.images` list of all page images. As for regions, lines and words, there image corresponds to the page image cropped to their bounding box. `Commentary` is a special, as it contains multiple images. It therefore comes a `self.images` attribute, which is equivalent to `[page.image for page in self.children.pages]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bounding boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Each text `TextContainer` below `Commentary`-level has a single `self.bbox` attribute representing its bounding box, i.e. the minimal rectangle around the object's words. From a python perspective, `self.bbox` as a `ajmc.commons.geometry.Shape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text\n",
    "Finally, every `TextContainer` has a `self.text` attribute, which results from the concatenation of the text contained by its word."

    "### The lazy system\n",
    "\n",
    "All these attributes can add up to relatively heavy computations. To keep object instantiation light and swift, `lazy_objects.lazy_property` is the default way to create an object's attribute. `lazy_property` is a decorator which allows for computing and storing properties only when they are called. When first created, objects should require no computation at all. This explains the inheritance based `__init__` system: each text container should expect only required arguments and (almost) nothing happens at `__init__` time."
